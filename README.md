# ðŸš€ Terraform Azure Baseline

Secure, scalable, and modular Terraform codebase for deploying enterprise-ready Azure landing zonesâ€”designed for real-world infrastructure teams, not cloud hobbyists.

---

## Why This Project Exists

Most Terraform repos are toy examples. This isn't one of them.

This is a tactical, reusable blueprint for building Azure environments aligned with best practices from:

- Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)
- CIS Benchmarks
- Enterprise security policies

Whether you're setting up dev/test or production, this baseline gives you a hardened starting pointâ€”with flexibility baked in.

## What This Repo Does

This repo includes modular Terraform code to:

âœ… Create Azure resource groups  
âœ… Configure role-based access control (RBAC)  
âœ… Deploy secure virtual networks with subnets  
âœ… Set up Network Security Groups (NSGs)  
âœ… Define Azure Policies and naming conventions  
âœ… Implement diagnostics + log forwarding (via Log Analytics)  
âœ… Support tagging for cost management + governance

## Tools + Tech Stack

- Terraform v1.4+
- Azure Provider (`azurerm`)
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD automation â€“ coming soon)
- Optional: Remote state backend via Azure Storage
